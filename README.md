About
=====

SeriesMarker is a tool that lets you keep track of watched episodes of
your favorite TVÂ series. It is inspired by [Series
Watcher](http://xf.iksaif.net/dev/serieswatcher.html/), which has been
discontinued by its original author, Corentin Chary
([iksaif](https://github.com/iksaif/)). SeriesMarker is a complete
re-implementation in Python.

SeriesMarker is licensed under the GNU GPL version 3.
